				<p>My real full name is Ruby May P. Aledo. My mother named me that because my father's name was Robert and she wanted it to start with letter R
					just the same as my father's and then the May because my mother's nickname is Imee, May and Mee sounds similar so she named it May. It's
					quite cute but I think it's really creative. I am carrying my parents' name with me everyday I wake up in the morning and start a life. As a 
					matter of fact, mom told me that her first idea of my name is Robbie but my aunts thought that it's like a boy's name, then she think of 
					something again and she thought of naming me Hannah Mae, but she decided not to because it's too far from their name. Then she came up with
					my name. I let out a sigh when I heard her story and I told her "I kinda loving Robbie better than my name now but okay" and she only laughed
					at me.

			<header class="section_header"><center><b>My Birthday!</b></center></header>
				<p>I was born on November 19, 1997, Wednesday. I don't know what to talk about this but okay. I don't really remember how they celebrate
					my first upto 5th birthday. I wasn't yet aware of what's happening around me, though and I just wished that I can go back to that time lol. 
					When I turned Six, mom always threw a birthday party for me, many invited guests came including my classmates from Nursery and some elders
					and colleagues of my mom, aunts, and also the neighbours (expected). I always have this 'Pabitin' thing whenever my birthday comes, and
					I don't really get a lot of foods or money hanging there because I am really really small, HAHAHAH and whenever I dont' get one, I'd cry
					the whole day until I fall asleep in my study table, yes I already have my study table. Let's skip to it now, shall we?
			
					When I turned 18, I really didn't like celebrations anymore, maybe just simple celebration with my family and that's it. I don't really
					like it when mom's spending too much just because of this occasion especially when that time we were having financial issues. Also, I don't
					really like being surprised with gifts, if they'd give me I'd be thankful but I don't really like being surprised because I end up crying.

		<p>I started my schooling in Palauig Ecumenical Learning Center and graduated as Salutatorian, I was nursery that time. Then I studied in Carmel Academy Pre-School in Palauig
           Zambales and graduated as Salutatorian. During my elementary years, I studied at Saint Augustine's School and I never fail to make my family proud
		   for I'm an honour student since 1st Grade. 
		   Highschool, my sweetest years. I studied Highschool at Zambales National High School in the program: Special Program in the Arts Major in Music
		   Instrumental. I graduated again without disappointing my mom, I was always in the 5th Honourable Mention though I failed Biology in my Sophomore year,
		   because I did not pass my projects: Bonsai and Bagoong.</p>
