		      <p>Hello! Welcome to my first website! ♥ I am really looking forward that you'll enjoy being here.
		         If you're interested to know more about me ♥ then you're free and very welcome here. I am very pleased that you have spared
		         your time to get to know me. I have prepared you some of the notes I have here in this very first page of my very first website.
				 I'm not going to take a lot of you time! I swear. :D I am not really good at writing things but I guess I've written enough here and 
				 I really don't want to bore you so... here goes nothing</p>

	    <section id = "section_one">
	      <header class="section_header"><center><b>WHAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW?</b></center></header>
		     <p>The main purpose of this website is for the people to get to know the basic information about me. :D I am not that really vocal about
		        myself especially to people I just got to know with. But if you already are my friend, then you'll enjoy being in my company (but I admit
		        that I don't really like to speak first hahaha"
		   
		        I'm saying this in the first page of this website because I want you to have an idea to what you're getting yourself into. I'm trying not
		        to sound it like a threat, I'm just kidding. This website is created today, August 13, 2017 at my terrace in my house and PS I'm not taking a
		        bath yet, sorry.</p>

		     <p>This section is all about what I feel, so now I'm going to answer that question.
		        I feel very stressed, sad and a little bit disappointed, but we'll come with the question of WHY...
   		        These past weeks have been really tough to me. If I'm really just able to shout it all out here, I would but it would ruin the image
		        of the people who turned their backs on me; who told things behind my back; who were the ones I thought my friends. I've come to get hold
		        on myself and stand on my feet to the ground and cheer myself up. I'm alone, but I'm not sad about it. Actually I'm happy and comfortable
		        with the company of my own. I tried to socialize but maybe it's nature's telling me I do not belong to the physical sh*tty world; that I 
		        belong to my own world. I really tried to communicate with people..But I don't really think this thing fits me..
				I tried to communicate what I feel but it ends up that I can only trust myself now and the chosen people I trust,YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE 
			    THAT I CHOSE AND TRUST because you know me because I'm your student and because you are able to know what I feel because you are an 
				anti-social-good-and-nice-instructor-and-adviser-of-my-org. :D</p>

           <header class= "partthree_header"><center><b> WHAT IF FEEL RIGHT NOW?</b></center></header>		
		     <p>
		        I have to be honest that I'm almost crying now, I've been crying for 2 days because of something I found out; PS: BAD NEWS ALWAYS HAPPENS
		        TO ME. I really don't know, but I always feel like I'm the Bad Karma's favorite target but damn, the key to withstand that karma is having
		        a positive-busy life. The only thing now that's always in my mind is that I have to prove them wrong, and that I'm going to get myself up,
		        that they can't put me down even if they'll try and try. I'll just keep my mouth shut because there's always dignity in silence and because
		        I have goals to achieve. F*ck Karma, I am going to be a successful person one day. </p>
